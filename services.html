                <td>Improve the appearance of discoloured or damaged teeth with beautifully realistic
                    crowns. Crowns have long been a cornerstone of restorative dentistry, enabling a
                    heavily filled or broken tooth to be restored to its original form. They also have an
                    important role to play in cosmetic dentistry.
                    Sometimes known as ‘caps’, crowns fit over the remaining part of a prepared tooth.
                    They may be provided when there is insufficient tooth substance to hold a filling and
                    to help protect root-treated back teeth.
                    Crowns can also be used to transform the appearance of a badly stained tooth or
                    one which contains discoloured fillings. The latest crowns are all-ceramic and so are
                    extremely realistic in appearance.</td>

                    life. It’s never too early to start a good oral health routine, so caring for your child’s
